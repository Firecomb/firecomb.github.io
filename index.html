<h1> CTP 431 Final Project : Simple MML Player with FM Synthesizer</h1>
<h2>2016 Fall CTP431 Final Project, Han Gyuhyun</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
<br>
Most of the web audio api actually use live input like MIDI, mouse click, and etc. It is hard to find web audio api <br>
that can play some music 'score' from outside. So I thought it is good to make web based score player. <br>
For music score format, I adopted MML, Macro-Music-Language. It contatins information about notes and length. <br>
To play music, it need any sound source like sunth. Connecting MML parser to controllerable synthesizer, <br>
user can play MML code with their own sound. </p>
