<h1> CTP 431 Final Project : Simple MML Player with FM Synthesizer</h1>
<p> 2016 Fall CTP431 Final Project <br>
I want to make some kind of score playing web api.
Finding some 'score-like' things, I can find MML code. <br>
MML is Music - Macro - Language. This code lines include note and length information as text. <br>
Those MML Codes are using for in-Game music scoring, like 'Mabinogi' or 'Archeage'. <br>
So I thought it is good to make web api based MML player, to listen the code before adapting it to game. <br>
I referred following pre-made javascript MML player.<br>

<br>
Using this parser, I must connect it to my FM Synthesizer(what I did as HW3).<br>
This code make MML code to MIDI signal(midi num/velocity). So I connected this converted midi signal to FM Synthesizer. 
<br>
<br>
Here is my work.
