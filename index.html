<h1> CTP 431 Final Project : Simple MML Player with FM Synthesizer</h1>
<h2>2016 Fall CTP431 Final Project, Han Gyuhyun</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
<br>
Most of the web audio api actually use live input like MIDI, mouse click, and etc. It is hard to find web audio api <br>
that can play some music 'score' from outside. So I thought it is good to make web based score player. <br>
For music score format, I adopted MML, Macro-Music-Language. Some games like 'Mabinogi' or 'Archeage', uses those <br>
kind of MML code to play the player's own music in game. It contains information about note and length.<br>
As a form of text code, it have evrything of note. For this reason, I tryed to make MML code player.<br>
<br>
Actually, parsing algorithm of MML is very complicate. Thus I must use pre-made javascript base MML parser.<br>
But this MML parser have only one simple synth. It need to make various sound. So I connected this MML parser<br>
to controllable synthesizer, which we did as hw3. Using new synthesizer, finally it can play various sound.<br>
</p>
<br>
<h3>Description</h3>
<h4>1. Sound Design </h4>
<p>First set the synthesizer to your favorite sound. You can check the sound using external midi source,<br>
virtual keyboard layout, or keyboard in front of you. C key is C4, and E key is C5.</p>
<h4>2. Find and fill MML code</h4>
<p>You can easily find MML code from internet. There are many songs like 'Auld Lang Syne', encrypted to MML code.<br>
Fill the MMLtoSMF box with your MML code.</p>
<h4>3. Play</h4>
<p>Click play button and listen music. You can also export MML code to simple MIDI file. <br>
</p>
<br>
<p> Caution : There are some differences between MML codes. For instance, 'Mabinogi' MML code and 'Archeage' MML code<br>
are slightly differen. So I recommend to follow MML code commands under the MML code letterbox</p>
